# ETL-Netflix

ETL Proposal


Project Participants: Sarah Green, Hector Ladero Rivas

As Netflix is one of the most popular websites when looking for movie entertaining, we want to study the content of this website to analyze the quality of its movies. To do that, we will compare Netflix’s movies with different rating sources. 
 
	 compare movies between the different data sources

	 compare ratings positions between the different sources

	 filter the movies and check how many of these “top movies” are currently displaying.
